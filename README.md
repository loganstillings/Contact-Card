# Contact-Card

This project allows the user to enter contacts to a list.  The contacts are entered in a form that asks for
first name, last name, and a description.  The user clicks a button and the information from the form 
gets put in a list.  The user may click on the text in the list to see the description.

One bug with this project is that when the user clicks for the description, it will show the descritption 
of the most current contact.  The user would have to enter a contact and click for the description before creating
additional contacts.  Otherwise, previous descriptions will get lost.
